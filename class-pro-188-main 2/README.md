Design thinking is the process of finding innovative solutions to the problems we are trying to solve.
The design thinking techniques help us to find user-centric solutions to the problem.\

design thinking
The whole design thinking process can be divided into 5 key steps:
● Empathy
● Define
● Ideate
● Prototype
● Test\
Empathy---\

Getting to know what users want, understanding the needs of the users requires a lot
of research.This phase requires interacting with actual users and understanding their needs for the product\

What will we make?
● Who can all use this?
● Why should we make this?
● How can we help humans with this application?
● Who will all benefit from this application
● How can this application help a large community?\
● Define
Defining the problem in a user-centric way.\

What is the problem statement?
● What are the challenges that we face?
● Defining a human-centric problem statement\
● Ideate
What are the elements that we will need?
● How is it going to work?
● How will it be given to end users?
● How is a scene going to look?
● What will be the rules in the game?
● Do we need to assign some points to the players?
● Is it going to be a single player or multiplayer?
● What will be the physics in the game?
● How can physics be implemented in 3D?
● Is there going to be any time limit?\

This phase focuses on creative idea generation. Ideas for possible solutions\
● Prototype
Sample output. It could be in the form of a sketch, flow diagrams etc. This phase helps us to go closer to the solutions.\

Scene
● Game rules
● Flight controls
● Player movement
● Points to the players
● Single player
● 3D collisions
● Timer
● 3D Tex\

● Test
Testing the result. This phase helps to figure out what will work and what will not. If
something is not working then go back a step and rethink the solution. Find out the fix and test again.\

ssues coming to the trial run?
● How can we fix them?
● Can we improve this prototype, or do we need a new idea?
● Did we try it with the end users?
● What was the user's reaction to the product?\

Design thinking is not a sequential process; that is, the phases are not completed one after another. We might need to go back to the stage again, if needed, to refine our solution to get better products.\
